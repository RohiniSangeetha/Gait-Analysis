# Gait-Analysis
Gait analysis, a powerful tool enabled by advancements in technology, holds the
potential for the early detection of Parkinson's disease, ultimately contributing to
improved patient outcomes. In this project, we aim to harness the capabilities of gait
analysis to predict Parkinson's disease based on the FOG symptom.
Here,we have explored the potential of gait analysis, which involves studying
individualâ€™s walking pattern, as a promising method for early disease
identification.Our comprehensive approach encompasses a well-defined pipeline
comprising data preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, evaluation,
and hyperparameter optimization. These features are then subjected to a range of
classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes,Convolutional Neural Network,
Random Forest,Gated Recurrent Unit,XG Boost,and LSTM to develop predictive
models and then we evaluated the performance of the algorithms using accuracy and
Confusion matrix.
Ultimately, this project is poised to contribute to the early detection of Parkinson's
disease, offering a valuable tool to clinicians and researchers in their efforts to combat
this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.
